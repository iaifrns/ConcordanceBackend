An armed conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups[t] has been taking place chiefly in and around the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023. On that day, Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise attack on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip, starting the most significant military escalation in the region, exactly 50 years after the Yom Kippur War.[70] After clearing Hamas militants from its territory, the Israeli military embarked on an extensive aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip followed by a large-scale ground invasion beginning on 27 October. Clashes have also occurred in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and with Hezbollah along the Israel–Lebanon border. The hostilities constitute the fifth war of the Gaza–Israel conflict, which is part of the broader Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

The war began when Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups launched a surprise offensive against Israel named "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood." The attack began with a barrage of rockets targeting Israel, while around 3,000 militants breached the Gaza–Israel barrier and attacked neighboring Israeli communities and military bases. During this attack, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, including 766 civilians.[u][71][72][73] Analysts suggested that Palestinian frustration at Arab–Israeli normalization despite the ongoing blockade of Gaza and rising settler violence in the West Bank contributed to the attack.[74][75][76] Hamas said it was responding to the blockade, occupation and settlements, as well as the alleged "Judaization" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque[77] and the plight of Palestinian refugees and prisoners,[78][79][80][81] who it sought to free by taking an estimated 253 Israeli and foreign captives to the Gaza Strip as leverage.[82][83]

Since the start of the Israeli operation,[84] more than 25,700 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza,[30] including over 10,000 children,[85] 152 UN staff members,[86] 70 journalists,[87] and 7,000 women[88] with another 7,000 people missing and presumed dead under the rubble of destroyed buildings.[89][88] By mid-December Israel had dropped 29,000 munitions on Gaza, destroying or damaging 70 percent of homes in the Strip.[90] Experts say that the scale and pace of destruction in Gaza is among the most severe in recent history.[91][92][93] A humanitarian crisis has developed in the Gaza Strip, with healthcare in a state of collapse,[94] shortages of food, clean water, medicine and fuel due to the blockade,[95][96][97] electricity and communications blackouts,[98] and the UN warning of potential famine.[99] It was widely reported that there is "no safe place in Gaza" as Israel struck areas it had previously told Palestinians to evacuate to.[100][101][102] The widespread civilian deaths have led to accusations of war crimes against both Israel and Hamas.[103][104] Nearly all of Gaza's 2.3 million population[105] and around 500,000 Israelis have been internally displaced,[106] while thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel,[107][108][109] and Israel has lost 195 further soldiers in its invasion as of 18 January 2024.[110]

Throughout the war, there have been widespread global protests that have primarily called for a ceasefire, with a smaller number demanding the release of the hostages.[111][112][113] Israel and the United States were internationally isolated amid global calls for a ceasefire,[114][115][116] with the latter vetoing multiple proposals for one at the UN Security Council,[117][118][119] instead allowing a resolution calling for a humanitarian pause to pass on 15 November.[120] During a subsequent seven-day truce, 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were exchanged for 240 Palestinian prisoners.[121] US military and diplomatic support for Israel during the war has been condemned by various human rights groups.[122][123][124] In response to Washington's backing of Israel, Iranian-backed militias attacked American bases in Iraq and Syria, while the US and UK engaged in conflict with the Yemeni Houthi movement over its attacks on ships in the Red Sea it claimed were linked to Israel.[125][126] Houthis said they will not stop until Gaza is supplied with food and medicine.[127]
